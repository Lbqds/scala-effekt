# Scala Effekt
The **Effekt** library allows you to structure your effectful programs
in a functional way. It thus represents an alternative to traditional
monad transformer based program structuring techniques.

The version of **Effekt** in this branch (which requires Dotty) is not yet published. 
So you need to clone the repo and run `sbt` yourselves.

The API is the one described in [this paper](http://ps.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/publications/brachthaeuser19effekt/).

Make sure to check out the examples.
